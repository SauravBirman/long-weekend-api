# 🗓️ Long Weekend Finder

This project is a Node.js + Express based web app that fetches public holiday data using the [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at) and finds long weekends (holidays combined with Saturday/Sunday). It includes a simple frontend built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The application allows users to:
- View all long weekends in the current year
- View the next upcoming long weekend
- Choose from multiple countries supported by the Nager.Date API
